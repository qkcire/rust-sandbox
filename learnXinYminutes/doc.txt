Rust is a programming language developed by Mozilla
Research. Rust combines low-level control over
performance with high-level convenience and safety
guarantees.

It achieves these goals without requiring a garbage
collector or runtime, making it possible to use Rust
libraries as a "drop-in replacement" for C.

Rust's first release, 0.1, occurred in January 2012,
and for 3 years development moved so quickly that
until recently the use of stable releases was discouraged
and instead the general advice was to use nightly builds.

On May 15th 2015, 1.0 was released with a complete
guarantee of backward compatibility. Improvements to
compile times and other aspects of the compiler are currently
available in the nightly builds. Rust has adopted a train-
based release model with regular releases every six
weeks. Rust 1.1 beta was made available at the same time
of the release of Rust 1.0.

Although Rust is a relatively low-level language, it has
some functional concepts that are generally found in 
higher-level languages. This makes Rust not only fast, but
also easy and efficient to code in.

There's a lot more to Rust -- this is just the basics of
Rust so you can understand the most important things. To
learn more about Rust, read the Rust Programming Language and
check out the /r/rust subreddit. The folkds on the #rust
channel on irc.mozilla.org are also always keen to help newcomers.

You can also try out features of Rust with an online compiler
at the official Rust playpen or on the main Rust website.
