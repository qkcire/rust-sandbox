The Rust Programming Language

1.2 HELLO, WORLD!
 Now that you've installed Rust, let's write your
 first Rust program. It's traditional when learning
 a new language to write a little program that prints
 the text Hello, World! to the screen, so we'll do the
 same here!

 NOTE:
  This book assume basica familliarity with the command
  line. Rust makes no specific demands about your editing
  or toolong or where your code lives, so if you prefer
  to use an integrated development environment(IDE) instead
  of the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE.
  Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the
  IDE's documentention for details. Recentl, the Rust
  team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support, and
  progress has been made raipidly on that front!

 CREATING A PROJECT DIRECTORY
  You'll start by making a directory to store your Rust code.
  It doesn't matter to Rust where your code lives, but for
  the exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a
  projects directory in your home directory and keeping all
  your projects there.

  Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make
  a projects directory and a directory for the "Hello, world!"
  project within the projects directory.

  For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

  mkdir ~/projects
  cd ~/projects
  mkdir hello_world
  cd hello_world

  WRITING AND RUNNING A RUST PROGRAM
  Next, make a snew source file and call it main.rs. Rust files
  always end with the .rs extension. If you're using more than
  one word in your filename, use an underscore to separate them.
  For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.

  Now open the main.rs file you just created and enter the code in
  Listing 1-1.

  Filename: main.rs
